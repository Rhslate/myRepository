<title> Why Border Collies are awesome! </title>
<body>
<p> Border Collies are one of the smartest breeds of dog, and they are very easy to train. </p>
<h1> I have a 3 year old Border Collie named Luca (rescue dog), and he is the best! </h1>
<h3> He needs a LOT of brushing... I can make an entire other dog with the fur I brush out. </h3>
<h6> He can be very needy at times, when he doesn't "get enough attention", according to him. </h6>
<main> I'm a big believer in rescuing dogs, as opposed to (potentially) spending thousands of dollars buying one </main>

        <p>ABOUT TULIPS! Tulips normally begin emerging from the ground in late winter or early spring. 
		If mild winter weather causes premature growth, the danger is not as great as it may seem. Tulips (and daffodils) have braved these cold temperatures before and are quite tolerant. 
		If winter temperatures return, it may delay growth. The snow is helpful, discouraging additional growth and protecting the foliage from extreme cold. </p>
